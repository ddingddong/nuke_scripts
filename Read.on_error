# Any file called init.py that is placed in one of NUKE’s plug-in path directories is automatically read whenever NUKE is launched. In other words, this file is read for both command-line and interactive sessions. Note that you should not use init.py for any commands that create UI elements, as this may lead to errors or prevent NUKE from launching.
# As mentioned above, the ~/.nuke directory is created when NUKE launches (if it doesn’t already exist). The path to this directory is added to NUKE’s plug-in path. You can view the plug-in path as follows:
# nuke.pluginPath()
# Result:
# ['C:/Users/hjeong/.nuke', 'C:\\Program Files\\Common Files/Nuke/7.0/plugins', 'C:/Program Files/Nuke7.0v10/plugins/user', 'C:/Program Files/Nuke7.0v10/plugins/icons', 'C:/Program Files/Nuke7.0v10/plugins']
